Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! 

I am a data enthusiast with experience in data analysis, dashboard building, data cleaning, data merging, and critical thinking. I am proficient in using various data analytics tools such as Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL to extract valuable insights from data. While I am currently in the process of setting up my account and will soon upload projects to showcase my skills, here's what you can expect from my portfolio:

## Skills and Expertise
